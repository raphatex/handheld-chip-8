[Octo](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/) is a high-level assembler for the [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) virtual machine, complete with an environment for testing programs, and tools for sharing your creations. Read about the project on [Itch.io](https://internet-janitor.itch.io/octo)!

Command Line Mode
-----------------
The Octo assembler can also be used as a command-line tool via a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) frontend:

```
$ ./octo
usage: octo [--decompile] [--options <file.json>] <source> [<destination>]
       if <source> has a .gif extension, unpack an existing octo cartridge.
       if <destination> has a .gif extension, create an octo cartridge file.
       if <destination> has an .html extension, create a standalone HTML5 build.
       if the specified options file does not exist, a new template will be created.

$ cat simple.8o
	: main
		va := 1
		vb := 2

$ ./octo simple.8o simple.ch8

$ hexdump simple.ch8
	0000000 6a 01 6b 02
	0000004
```

The `--decompile` option can be used to send an existing Chip8 binary through Octo's general-purpose decompiler.

The `--options` option allows you to specify a JSON file with settings for all of Octo's feature flags and palette configuration, which will be used for exports and as hints during decompilation. If the specified file does not exist, a template will be created with default settings.

If you're interested in using Octo from the command line, you might like [c-octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/c-octo).

Sharing Your Programs
---------------------
Octo has a `share` feature which stores source code and configuration metadata and produces a URL you can share with others. By default, Octo stores programs in its own backend, indexed based on a `key`.

Using the "Save HTML" button in the "Binary Tools" panel of the toolbox, you can generate a single HTML file containing the Octo emulator and your program, allowing you to easily host a game yourself or on sites like [Itch.io](https://internet-janitor.itch.io/an-evening-to-die-for). Octo can be configured to offer adaptive multitouch controls, making your games playable on mobile devices and tablets!

Octo can also save "Cartridges" which embed programs and their metadata in an animated GIF. Cartridges are easy to share via email or image hosting sites, and include the source code of your programs, so others can riff on your creations:

Finally, [Doct](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/tree/gh-pages/tools/Doct) is an experimental tool for building standalone binaries which run Octo programs. Give it a whirl!
